NOTE: You can also download a Docker Container with all of these scripts embedded. However, this method may contain older versions of the script if I haven't pushed a new Docker Container Image. More details from:
https://hub.docker.com/r/mipetrin/aio-brkdcn-2011/


```YAML
# docker pull mipetrin/aio-brkdcn-2011
```


Alternatively, to ensure you always have the latest version of these scripts, you can build the Docker Container locally on your machine:

```YAML
# docker build -t <name/tag> .
```

WARNING:

These scripts are meant for educational/proof of concept purposes only - as demonstrated at Cisco Live and/or my other presentations. Any use of these scripts and tools is at your own risk. There is no guarantee that they have been through thorough testing in a comparable environment and I am not responsible for any damage or data loss incurred as a result of their use
